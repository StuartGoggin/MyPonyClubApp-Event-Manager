# Enhancement: Managing the Event Schedule

## Intent
To provide a robust workflow for uploading, reviewing, approving, and managing event schedule documents, ensuring compliance and transparency for all events.

## Prompts Used
- Introduce the capability to capture an Event Schedule, store it with an event, have it reviewed and approved separately to the actual event.
- Document requirements, prompts, and workflow for schedule upload, review, approval, and status indication.
- Summarise and track remaining steps for full implementation.

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Event List Integration
- Show schedule status flags (pending, approved, rejected) in event lists and cards for quick visibility.

### 2. Permissions & Access Control
- Ensure only organisers can upload schedules.
- Only zone approvers/admins can review/approve/reject schedules.

### 3. Notifications
- Notify zone approvers when a schedule is submitted.
- Notify organisers when a schedule is approved or rejected.

### 4. Audit Trail
- Log all schedule uploads, reviews, approvals, rejections, and updates for transparency.

### 5. Testing & UX Polish
- Test the full workflow end-to-end.
- Refine UI/UX for clarity and ease of use.

### 6. Documentation
- Update blueprint and README with workflow, permissions, and usage instructions.
