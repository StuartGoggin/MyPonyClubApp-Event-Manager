### Email Configuration (Required for Event Request Notifications)
The Phase 1 notification system requires a Resend API key for production email delivery:

1. **Get Resend API Key** (Production Only):
   - Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Navigate to **API Keys** section in your dashboard
   - Click **"Create API Key"**
   - Copy the generated key (starts with `re_`)

2. **Configure Environment Variable**:
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **Important**: Replace `re_your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual Resend API key

3. **Development Mode** (No API Key Required):
   - If no `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured, the system runs in **development mode**
   - Email content is logged to the console instead of being sent
   - All functionality works normally, but emails are simulated
   - Perfect for testing the notification system without email service setup
   - Console output shows complete email details including recipients and attachments

4. **Production Mode** (With API Key):
   - With `RESEND_API_KEY` configured, emails are actually sent via Resend service
   - Multi-recipient notifications: requester, zone approvers, and super users
   - Professional HTML email templates with PDF and JSON attachments
   - Real-time email delivery with proper error handling
   - Email queue integration for administrative review and management

5. **Phase 1 Notification Features**:
   - **Immediate Confirmation**: Requester receives instant email with PDF attachment
   - **Zone Coordinator Alerts**: Automatic notifications to appropriate zone approvers
   - **Super User Notifications**: Administrative emails with both PDF and JSON exports
   - **Reference Number Tracking**: Unique identifiers for all event requests
   - **Professional Templates**: HTML-formatted emails with complete event details
   - **Queue Management**: Integration with existing email queue system for admin review
