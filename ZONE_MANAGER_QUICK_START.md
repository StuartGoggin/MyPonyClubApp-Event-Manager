1. **Check Daily**
   - Review pending approvals at least once a day
   - Don't leave clubs waiting

2. **Be Thorough**
   - Check all details before approving
   - Better to ask questions than approve incorrectly

3. **Communicate Clearly**

### 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't approve without reviewing**

   - Verify all details

2. **Don't reject without feedback**
   - Clubs need to know what to fix
   - Generic rejections aren't helpful

3. **Don't delay unnecessarily**
