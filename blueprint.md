# PonyClub Events Blueprint

This document outlines the features and ideas for the PonyClub Events application.

## Implemented Features

- **Calendar Weekend Highlighting**: Saturdays and Sundays are visually highlighted in the calendar view to make them more prominent.
- **Calendar Year View**: A "Year" button has been added to the calendar to provide a full year-long overview of events.
- **Hierarchical Event Filtering**: Users can filter calendar events based on a hierarchy:
    - All of Victoria
    - Specific Zones
    - Specific Clubs within a Zone
- **Distance-Based Event Filtering**: Users can find events within a specific distance from a selected "home" club. This includes:
    - A toggle to switch between location and distance filtering.
    - Dropdowns to select a home club and a distance radius (e.g., 25km, 50km, 100km).
- **Event Source Filtering**: A set of checkboxes in the sidebar allows users to filter events based on their source:
    - PCA Event Calendar
    - Event Secretary
    - Zone Calendars

## Future Ideas

-   Map view integration for distance-based searching.
