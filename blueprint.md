### Event Schedule Management & Approval Workflow (August 27, 2025) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Overview
An Event Schedule is a document (usually a PDF) created by an event organiser to advertise the event and publish the applicable rules and details. It is typically created a few months before the event, while the event date may be booked up to a year in advance. Every event must have a schedule document.

### ‚úÖ Implementation Status: COMPLETED
**Firebase Storage Integration**: Complete cloud-based file storage and management system for event schedule documents:

- **‚úÖ Cloud Storage Solution**: Firebase Storage integration with bucket `ponyclub-events.firebasestorage.app`
- **‚úÖ File Upload System**: Robust upload handling for PDF, DOCX, and other document formats
- **‚úÖ Public URL Generation**: Automatic generation of public download URLs for approved schedules
- **‚úÖ Secure File Management**: Files organized by event ID with unique naming to prevent conflicts
- **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for upload failures and storage issues

### ‚úÖ Technical Implementation
- **API Route Structure**: `/api/events/[id]/schedule/upload` - Next.js App Router compliant endpoint
- **Frontend Component**: Event schedule upload form with file validation and progress feedback
- **Backend Processing**: File upload to Firebase Storage with metadata storage in Firestore
- **Storage Path Structure**: `event-schedules/{eventId}/{uniqueFileName}` for organized file management
- **Database Integration**: Schedule metadata stored in Firestore with file URLs and approval status

### Requirements & Workflow
- **‚úÖ Upload & Association**: The Event Schedule document is uploaded and associated with an event via Firebase Storage.
- **‚è≥ Review Task Creation**: Uploading a schedule creates a review task for the applicable zone. [PENDING]
- **‚è≥ Zone Approval**: The zone approver reviews the document for compliance and approves or rejects it. [PENDING]
- **‚è≥ Document Updates**: The schedule can be updated after submission. If updated, the new version is sent for approval. [PENDING]
- **‚è≥ Reapproval on Update**: If the schedule is updated after approval, it must be reapproved. [PENDING]
- **‚è≥ Status Indication**: Wherever the event appears, indicate the schedule status: [PENDING]
  - If missing: show nothing
  - If submitted: show a neat 'Schedule Pending' status flag
  - If approved: show an 'Approved' status flag
- **‚è≥ Download Capability**: If an event has an approved schedule, users can download the document. [PENDING]

### User Prompts & Notes
> I want to introduce the capability to capture an Event Schedule, store it with an event, have it reviewed and approved separately to the actual event.
>
> An Event schedule is a document - usually a PDF that an event organiser will create to advertise the event and publish the applicable rules and details of the event. IT's usually created a few months before the event - whereas the event date might be booked up to a year in advance.
>
> The Event schedule is an important document, and every event has to have one. The process for an event schedule is that it will be uploaded to an event. This creates a review task for the applicable zone. The approver on the zone will review the document and determine if it's compliant - if it is then they will approve the document.
>
> The Schedule document might be updated after it's been submitted for approval. In which case that's fine it can be updated and the updated version sent for approval.
>
> If the schedule is updated after it's been approved then it needs to be reapproved.
>
> I would like to indicate the status of the schedule wherever the event appears. If a schedule is missing then don't show anything. If it's been submitted then show it as a neat Schedule Pending status flag. Once approved then again show the status flag. If I click on an event and there is an approved schedule I should be able to download it.
>
> I would like you to add a new Section to the blueprint to document these requirements, and I would like you to include these prompts into that section as well.
