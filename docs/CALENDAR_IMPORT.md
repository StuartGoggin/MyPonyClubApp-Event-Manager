## File Format Guidelines

### CSV Format
```csv
Event Name,Start Date,End Date,Club Name,Location,Event Type,Coordinator
Spring Rally,2025-03-15,2025-03-15,Melbourne Pony Club,Melbourne Showgrounds,Rally,Jane Smith
```

### Excel Format
- Use clear column headers in the first row
- Date formats: YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY, or MM/DD/YYYY
- Keep club names consistent with registered clubs

### Text Format
The system can parse various text formats with intelligent detection of:
- Event names and dates
- Club references
- Location information
- Event types

## Club Matching System

### Automatic Matching
The system uses fuzzy string matching to automatically identify clubs:
- **Exact Match**: 100% confidence for perfect matches
- **Partial Match**: 60-90% confidence for close matches
- **Word Match**: 30-60% confidence for keyword matches

### Manual Correction
For unmatched or low-confidence matches:
1. Click the edit button for the event
2. Select the correct club from the dropdown
3. Update other event details as needed
4. Save changes

## Batch Management

### Import Tracking
Each import creates a batch with:
- Unique batch ID for tracking
- Creation timestamp
- File information
- Event count and status
- Import results

### Rollback System
Complete rollback capability:
- Deletes all events from the batch
- Maintains audit trail
- Cannot be undone once executed
- Updates batch status to "rolled_back"

## API Endpoints

### Import Batches API
- `POST /api/admin/import-batches` - Create, update, execute, or rollback batches
- `GET /api/admin/import-batches` - Retrieve batch information

### Batch Operations
- **create**: Create new import batch
- **update**: Update batch data
- **execute**: Import events to database
- **rollback**: Delete imported events

## Security Considerations

### File Validation
- File size limits (configurable)
- File type validation
- Content sanitization
- Malware scanning (recommended)

### Access Control
- Admin-only access required
- Audit logging of all operations
- Batch tracking for accountability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### File Upload Failures
- Check file size (must be under limit)
- Verify file format is supported
- Ensure file is not corrupted

#### Club Matching Problems
- Verify club names in uploaded file
- Check for spelling variations
- Use manual matching for special cases

#### Import Failures
- Check for validation errors in review step
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Verify date formats are correct

### Error Recovery
- Use rollback for failed imports
- Check browser console for detailed errors
- Contact system administrator for database issues

## Best Practices

### File Preparation
1. Use consistent club name spelling
2. Standardize date formats
3. Include all required event information
4. Remove duplicate entries before upload

### Review Process
1. Always review parsed data carefully
2. Verify club matches before importing
3. Check event dates and details
4. Test with small files first

### After Import
1. Verify events appear correctly in the system
2. Check for any missing information
3. Update event details if needed
4. Keep original files for reference
